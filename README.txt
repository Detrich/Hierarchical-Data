This program allows for easily moving data using MPTT, a helpful add on to django. Using MPTT we can treat all our data like a gigantic tree.
To use this program simple create a super user in the danjgo admin pannel and then create simple files/folders to move around.
Once you have created them they will show on the root page in the correct order as moved around.
